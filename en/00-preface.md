# ðŸ“– A Short Preface

### *A Book of Concepts*

Weâ€™ve observed that when developers attempt to transition from Web2 to Web3, they often encounter significant challenges. This is because Web3 technology isnâ€™t just an evolution â€” itâ€™s a revolution. It demands a fundamentally different mindset, a new set of values, and a unique approach to coding and problem-solving.

Unlike traditional development, Web3 projects rarely allow developers to focus solely on their technical tasks. These projects often carry profound meaning, requiring a holistic understanding of the product and the ecosystem in which it exists.

With this book, we hope to make your transition to Web3 as smooth as possible. Our goal is not only to teach you the technical part but also to help you deeply understand the impact you can have with this transformative technology.

Thatâ€™s why the workshops and content in this book focus more on concepts than just coding.
