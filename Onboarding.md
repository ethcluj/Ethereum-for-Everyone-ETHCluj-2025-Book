# üõ†Ô∏è Practical Onboarding Guide for contributors

### *How to Contribute and Deliver a Workshop from a Chapter*

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Workshop Format

- **Duration:** 40‚Äì50 minutes  
- **Q&A:** 5‚Äì10 minutes

Each chapter is designed to be delivered as a workshop. It will be part of the open-source book *Ethereum for Everyone*, serving as:
- a **laboratory module**
- a **learning resource**
- a **foundation for community workshops**

---

## üéØ Target Audience

- Web2 developers exploring blockchain and smart contracts  
- Students looking for hands-on labs and projects  
- Universities integrating Web3 into their curricula  
- Companies wanting to upskill their teams with decentralized technologies

## üß© Contribution Workflow

### 1. Draft the Article ‚Äì Guidelines

#### ‚úÖ Explain Concepts First
- Start with foundational explanations before deep-diving into the technical.
- Emphasize **Ethereum** and the **EVM** as the core of Web3.
- Introduce key terms early (smart contracts, transactions, gas fees).

#### ‚úÖ Provide Real-World Examples
- Make it relatable:
  - **Smart contracts:** like a rental agreement for a car.
  - **Tokenization:** real estate, digital art (NFTs), supply chain.

#### ‚úÖ Provide Insights
- Assume this is their **first contact** with the topic.
- Emphasize the **why** behind each concept.
- Mention **common mistakes** and how to avoid them.

#### ‚úÖ Keep It Simple
- Use **plain language**; avoid jargon unless explained.
- Step-by-step breakdowns for technical processes.
- Keep code **short and focused** on one idea per example.

#### ‚úÖ Don‚Äôt Overcomplicate
- Don‚Äôt overload with too many advanced concepts.
- Link to deeper resources instead.
- Let the article be a **launchpad**, not a deep dive.

#### ‚úÖ Create a Clear, Actionable Learning Flow
- Ensure the structure helps beginners **grasp ideas quickly**.
- Each section should:
  - Have a clear **takeaway**
  - Include a **hands-on** component (e.g. coding task, CLI command, short quiz)

---

### 2. Request Feedback & Iterate

- **Create a new branch** for your chapter contribution: git checkout -b chapter-05-smart-contracts
- Once the draft is ready, **open a pull request (PR)** in that branch.
- Use the PR to **ask for feedback** from the community and project maintainers.
- Engage in discussion and iterate based on review comments.

---

### 3. Create a Supporting Presentation (PPT)

- Convert your content into **slides**.
- Include visuals, diagrams, and code snippets where relevant.
- Keep slides clean and minimal; avoid heavy blocks of text.

---

### 4. Present It Online or Onsite to ETHCluj (Before June)

- Deliver a **workshop-style session** using your slides and code.
- Encourage:
- Q&A
- Live walkthroughs of code
- Interaction with attendees

- After the workshop, perform a **Community Review**:
- Collect feedback, questions, and suggestions.
- Use this input to **improve your article and slides**.

---

### 5. Refine & Finalize

- Polish both the written chapter and presentation.
- Ensure clarity, flow, and accuracy.
- Make final commits and mark the PR ready for merging.

---

### 6. Present at a Conference

- Selected chapters may be featured at **ETHCluj or other Web3 events**.
- This is a chance to bring your learning module to a broader audience.
- You‚Äôll contribute not just to the book, but to the growing Ethereum educational ecosystem.

## üåç Language Note

For those who are native Romanian speakers, please write your chapter in **both English and Romanian**. These workshops will also be used by universities in Romania, so having a Romanian version is essential.

Much appreciation for your contribution and effort in making this accessible üôè
